codes starting from 1st /auth folder 1****
streams 2****
etc.


} catch {
	return next(error) ????
}

shouldnt return an actual error. Should return generic error and log the error
use the handleUncaughtErroResponse()

make sure the protected routes unit tests with middleware and env vars is safe

email-available, username-available - think about if a limit should be set. These would be used either not at all, since creating a user would do this.

updateOne() make the 2nd argument just the value, then use the $set in the updateOne

make sure if no document is found in the DB to think about returning the same responses, 404.

responses.success(undefined, "Account is already verified") should be an easier way to not send undefined.

login, line ~86, why am i fetching the user again?
